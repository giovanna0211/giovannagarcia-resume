        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Giovanna Garcia. I am a current Sociology student at the University of California Riverside. I have experience working in different clubs in high school, as well as volunteer work at my local animal shelter. Throughout my sophomore and junior year, I was involved in a dance club otherwise known as K-CLUB. A club where I learned a lot of abilities. It helped me gain leadership skills, as I practiced the different choreographies we were learning to assist in teaching the new members. It allowed me to develop communication and interpersonal skills since I was always interacting with the other members. Especially helpful when we would promote the club at different events our school would host to try to get more people interested in joining the club. It also aided my video and audio editing skills. My video editing skills were enhanced due to putting out multiple videos on social media platforms to promote the club, and my audio editing skills were improved due to the different songs we would have to perform.  Because we were required to make short remixes of the audio to fit it into the school rallies, I assisted in shortening the audio, as well as remixing it to mix into another version. <br><br>

        I also did Spanish Club in high school. I was the treasurer of the club. I further improved my leadership skills in this club because of it, and because we had to socially promote the club by different means, such as holding a booth in events where we would have to talk about our club, what we do, and what the experience is like. I influenced people to join the club. I also involved myself in graphic design for this club, since I would design posters or such to promote the club, post them on social media, or hang them around the school campus. It allowed me to improve my editing skills.<br><br>

        I also have experience in volunteer work. I volunteered at the Rancho Cucamonga Animal Shelter, where I was tasked with multiple assignments. I took care of the animals and entertained them with toys, as well as sanitized and cleaned their kennels. I also interacted with customers that came into the shelter and influenced them to think about adopting an animal if they could. Doing so improved my communication skills, as I was exposed to multiple people and gave them advice on how to care for different animals and what best animal would suit their lifestyle. My passion for working with others allowed me to positively interact with those that came up to me, a skill valuable in workplaces that have communication as a necessary attribute. 
        
        Because of these experiences, I have been able to improve my communication, editing, and critical thinking skills. I hold a Seal of Biliteracy for the languages of Spanish and English, and I am also very adaptive in the workplace, with a willingness to learn and teach others. These valuable attributes will allow me to thrive in the workplace!
